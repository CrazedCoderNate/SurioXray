# SuroiXRay Extension

Allows for X-raying buildings, trees, etc on suroi.io

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the SuroiXRay Folder**  
   - Obtain the `suroixray` folder from the source or repository.

2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**  
   - Open a new tab in Chrome and navigate to:  
     ```
     chrome://extensions/
     ```

3. **Enable Developer Mode**  
   - Toggle the switch at the top right to turn on **Developer Mode**.

4. **Load the Unpacked Extension**  
   - Click on **"Load unpacked"**.  
   - Browse to the location where you downloaded the `suroixray` folder.  
   - Select the folder to load the extension.

5. **Play Suroi.io**  
   - Open the game at:  
     ```
     suroi.io
     ```
6. **Coming soon**
   Survev.io seems to be more popular. I will implement aimbot, modifiable zoom and xray.

7. **How it works**
   Extension listens for requests for specific files and swaps them out for spoofed images.
